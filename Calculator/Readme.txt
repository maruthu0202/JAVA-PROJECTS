# My Calculator – Java AWT

A simple **Calculator application** built using **Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**.
This project demonstrates the use of **Frames, Buttons, Labels, Event Handling, and Window Listeners** in Java to create a basic GUI-based calculator.

## ✨ Features

* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Modulo operations
* Supports decimal numbers
* Clear (`CE`) button to reset input
* Backspace functionality
* Positive/Negative toggle
* Responsive GUI built with **Java AWT**

## 📂 Project Structure

```
MyCalc.java   # Main source code
```

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. Run the program to open the calculator window.
2. Enter numbers using the digit buttons (0–9).
3. Use the operation buttons (+, -, *, /, %) to perform calculations.
4. Press `=` to get the result.
5. Use `CE` to clear, `back` to delete the last digit, and `+/-` to toggle negative values.
